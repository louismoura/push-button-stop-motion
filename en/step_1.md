## What you will make
In this resource, you will make a stop motion animation using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module to take pictures, controlled by a push button connected to the Pi's GPIO pins, programmed using Python, the picamera library and GPIO Zero. The photos will be automatically generated into a video by using the command line tool `avconv`.

## What you will learn
By creating a push button stop motion machine with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to set up and use the Raspberry Pi camera module
- How to use the Python picamera library to capture photographs
- How to connect a button to the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi
- How to control the camera with a button using GPIO Zero
- How to generate a video from the command line using `avconv`

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
