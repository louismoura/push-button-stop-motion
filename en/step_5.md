## Test the camera

- Open a terminal window from the application menu. Enter the following command:

    ```bash
    raspistill -k
    ```

- You should see a preview appear on the screen. It doesn't matter if the picture is upside-down; you can configure this later. Press `Ctrl + C` to exit the preview.

- Run the command `ls` to see the files in your home directory; you should see `image1.jpg` listed.

- Click the file manager icon in the taskbar and you should see some folders and files. Double-click `image1.jpg` to preview it.
